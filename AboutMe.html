            Hello there! My name is Juliette Savard and I <strong><em>love</em></strong> writing! I first started writing
            back when I was around four years old. I know, I have been writing for a <strong><em>long</em></strong> time.
            I would draw pictures and tell my mother what to write on each page because I could not read or write yet. I
            wrote my first book when I was around thirteen years old, but never ended up publishing it. It still became a
            big accomplishment in my life and even though it might never be my main job, I have always known I wanted to
            at least write on the side. That is when I started to work with my drama teacher at my school and I would write
            plays and short story for fun which she would always read and give me feedback on. One day, she suggested that
            I write a ten-minute play and submit it to a writing contest. I decided to do it for fun and then forgot about it
            since I did not think I would come even <em>close</em> to winning. To my surprise, I found out months later that
            I had won fourth place and with that came a bunch of cool opportunities, like meeting professional actors and writers
            and getting the chance to chat with them. The following year I submitted another play to that contest and ended
            up winning second place and even more opportunities were offered to me. It made me realize that I really had
            a passion for it and the pride I felt when people would read my stories was something indescribable. When
            the pandemic hit, I started writing songs as well and realize that writing came in many shapes and forms.
            I had a lot of fun trying all of them and spending those six months locked in my house, writing down all of
            my ideas and showing them to my family members. I also started writing online and ended up gaining a quite
            big amount of readers, which increased my confidence in my stories and writing. Nowadays, I keep writing
            every time I can and know that I will <strong>always</strong> write on the side no matter what I end up doing with my life!
