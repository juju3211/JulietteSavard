                            <em>Le journal d'Élizabeth</em> is the first novel I ever wrote. I wrote it back when I was in middle
                            school and worked really hard on it. I had tried multiple times in the past to write a book, but I would
                            always get sick of it and abandon the project after a couple of weeks. However, <em>Le journal
                            d'Élizabeth</em> is the first story I ever stuck with and completed. I never published it and reading
                            it now it is not my proudest writing or ideas, but I am still proud of it being my first novel and
                            all the hard work that was put into it. Here's the synopsis: "This story takes place in 1942, in the
                            middle of the Second World War in Peggy's Cove, a small village in western Nova Scotia. Elizabeth is
                            a gifted 15-year-old girl. She has been orphaned since she was 3 years old and has little memory of
                            her parents and has never known how they died. Elizabeth is sent to a boarding school for gifted girls.
                            There, she soon meets Emma-Rose, another girl her age who becomes her best friend and ally in this
                            new life. What happens when she meets the handsome Noah, for whom she feels a little more than just
                            friendship? And what will happen when the older girls turn on her for some absurd reason? Elizabeth
                            thought she had finally found peace and quiet in this new life, but she will soon realize that she
                            was wrong..."

                            <em>Le choix d'Adam</em> is my second novel I wrote. After finishing <em>Le journal d'Élizabeth</em>
                            I tried to write a sequel for it, and a bunch of other stories, but once again never stuck to any of
                            them. Nonetheless, one day I randomly got an idea for a new story and felt the urge to write the first
                            chapter right away. I did so and was extremely proud of it. In the following days, I tried to write
                            a second chapter, but I just could not seem to find the right words or ideas and ended up abandoning
                            the project for a whole year. I picked up again after joining my high school writing club and decided
                            to just write a second chapter no matter if it would be good or not and I would just change it later.
                            After doing that, I started actively working on the book and it became my favourite story I ever
                            imagined and wrote. It is still a now work in progress, but I am almost done and cannot wait to edit
                            it before sending it out to publishers. Hopefully, one day it will make its way on the bookstores'
                            shelves. Here's the synopsis: "Adam returns to school for the first time, six months after the death
                            of his father. When he arrives, his best friend Mathis and his ex-girlfriend Cindy are thrilled to
                            finally have him back. However, they soon realize that the old Adam they knew, always active and full
                            of life, has given way to a new Adam who is much calmer and closed in on himself. The young man refuses
                            to return to his old life and remains isolated until he meets a new student who immediately catches
                            his attention. Victoria seems shy, but perfect at first sight and immediately charms the teenager.
                            But what happens when he realizes that everyone is hiding secrets? And what will he decide when he
                            has to make the hardest choice of his life? At 16 years old, he will quickly realize the amount of
                            responsibility he now has."

                                    School 10 Minute Plays Writing Contest</em></a>. I wrote this play based on a short story I wrote
                                for my nineth grade English class. I was really proud of this idea and enjoyed turning it into a
                                play a lot. I ended up winning fourth place in the contest, which pleasantly surprised me. I got
                                the chance to follow a writing workshop and go see a play at
                                <a href="https://www.neptunetheatre.com/">Neptune Theatre</a>. Afterwards, I met the writer of the
                                play and the cast and got the chance to talk to them and ask them questions. It was an amazing experience
                                and it gave me a lot of confidence in my writing. This play tell the story of two young girls who
                                are having a sleepover after not seeing each other in a while. They are left alone at one of their
                                houses and everything is going great until they find some green slime on the floor. From there
                                everything deescalate and they have to fight to save their lives at their innocent little sleepover.

                                <a href="https://www.theatrens.ca/dramafest/dramafest-10-minute-play-contest"><em>Dramafest High
                                    School 10 Minute Plays Writing Contest</em></a>. I wrote this play on the idea of creating tension
                                and suspense just with one conversation between two characters. I wanted it to be the simplest stage
                                possible and for the story to just be told through the conversation. I also really wanted to be as
                                vague as possible with the plot, so the reader or the audience could try to guess by themselves what
                                really happened. The play tells the story of two childhood friends who accidentally bump into each other
                                one day and decide to sit and reminiscing the past. However, as the discussion goes, it becomes obvious
                                they did not grow up in normal circumstances and their childhoods were a lot darker than they first
                                appeared to be. I ended up winning second place that year. Second place came with all the same
                                opportunities as fourth place, plus the chance to work one on one with a professional stage director
                                and playwriter since a dramatic reading of my play was recorded and posted on YouTube. It also came
                                with a cash price, which made me realize for the first time that maybe it could be possible to make
                                some money off my writing. The video of the reading is still available on YouTube:

                            <p>I have written a <em>lot</em> of songs in my life. Listing them all here would be way too long, but
                                it is something I started doing during the pandemic and kept doing afterwards. It turned out to be
                                really useful when it comes to my mental health and like expressing myself and feelings in a healthy
                                way. It also mixes my love for poetry and my love for music together, which I absolutely love. I decided
                                to learn the piano with all the free time I now had during the pandemic and I fell in love with the
                                instrument. I knew right away that I wanted to keep playing it and write stuff with it. Here's a video of
                                me playing one of my favourite songs:

                                I have written a couple of just plain music pieces, but they are rarer than songs. I do enjoy
                                sometimes only writing my ideas through notes.

                                            tells a story of self-discovery that people can focus on while meditating.

                                            I wrote this piece after playing around with chords inversion and ended up writing a piece
                                            that I thought would be perfect for an interlude in a sad album and loved it. It feels like
                                            a break from heartbreak whilst still capturing the sadness felt. A little bit like when you
                                            start to get over someone and forget them for a brief instant. You finally have a break for
                                            a moment, but the sadness still does not leave you.
